- **Metrics:** Customer segments (RFM analysis), geographic sales distribution, and customer lifetime value (CLV).

### 5. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**
- Missing values in columns like `STATE`, `TERRITORY`, etc., were addressed.
- Data was cleaned and prepared for analysis, focusing on the essential variables for answering the analytical questions.
- Data spans from 2003 to 2005, with incomplete data for 2005.
